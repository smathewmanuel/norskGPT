# Instructions for Setting Up Config

This folder contains the OpenAI API key. Follow these instructions to set it up:

1. Go to the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/) and click on the "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the page. If you already have an account, log in with your credentials and skip to Step 4.
2. Fill out the sign-up form with your information and click on the "Create account" button.
3. Once you have created your account, log in to the OpenAI website.
4. Click on your username in the top right corner of the page and select "API Keys" from the drop-down menu.
5. On the API Keys page, click on the "Create an API key" button.
6. Enter a description for your API key and select the appropriate permissions for your use case.
7. Click on the "Create" button to create your new API key.
8. Your new API key will be displayed on the screen. Make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place, as you will need it to access the OpenAI API.
9. Rename `sample-config.yml` to `config.yml`.
10. Copy just the API key and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `config.yml` file with your actual API key.
11. You can also modify the `system_role_behavior` in the `config.yml` file.

After completing these steps, your OpenAI API key will be stored in the `config.yml` file and ready for use.
